## 👋 Welcome to the OpenPecha Data GitHub!

OpenPecha Data is a collection of 14.5k—and growing—repositories containing free open-source Tibetan text files in the OpenPecha format (OPF). Most repos contain individual texts, while some contain collections. These collections include corpuses, such as a machine learning one, and collections of texts, such various Kangyur and Tengyur editions.
